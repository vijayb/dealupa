		<br><br>
		<b>Seattle, Washington – November 3rd, 2011 – </b>Dealupa (http://dealupa.com/) launched this week, bringing organization and ease to the rapidly growing deal space. Dealupa aggregates all the daily deal sites into a simple, full-screen, map-based interface. Dealupa's full-text search engine gives users, for the first time, a way to easily find what they’re looking for amongst the masses of deals available on the web. 
		<br><br>
		Despite the intense competition in the deal space, it’s hard for users to find all relevant, active deals in one place. Started by two former Googlers, both engineers, including the founding engineer of The Harvard Connection (referenced in the movie, "The Social Network"), Dealupa was built as the pet project of two guys who loved deals but hated the hassle. Vijay Boyapati, Dealupa cofounder says, “I found myself browsing Groupon, LivingSocial and other deal sites, then having to open Google Maps, then Yelp--next thing I know I have 5 tabs open just to figure out if this was a deal I wanted. There had to be an easier way.”
		<br><br>
		With this approach to deals, Dealupa opens up the space to an entirely new customer base–-people who want deals but don’t want to put the time and effort into finding them. Dealupa addresses usability in a dramatically different way for the industry. It essentially opens up the space from what was traditionally an impulse buyer market, to an intent-driven user base. With Dealupa you can zoom into your neighborhood, search for ‘sushi’, and eliminate low Yelp-rated places. “I can finally find deals I want without waking up to an inbox of spa offers every morning”, says one of Dealupa’s early users.
		<br><br>
		It’s no coincidence that Dealupa, which focuses on finding deals easily, was started by two former Googlers. “We like search and clean, intuitive interfaces”, says co-founder Sanjay Mavinkurve, “and no one was doing this well with deals.” Dealupa’s focus is on building an extraordinary product and making deal discovery easy for users everywhere. In a landscape of site with cluttered, busy interfaces, Dealupa stands apart with a refreshingly simple, easy-to-use, and clean experience.
		<br><br>
		The site even incorporates the new wave of vacation packages increasingly being offered by deal sites. Dealupa Vacations maps out discounted hotel stays around the U.S. (and some around the world) so users can quickly see if there are any deals in their target destination. Currently in its beta version, Dealupa is aggressively building out new product features including a personalized email digest, additional categorization and more advanced search criteria. "Instead of daily emails bombarding me with 100 deals I don't want and one that I do, let's send infrequent emails--maybe only once in 10 days!--but with the precise deals you care about," says Sanjay.
		<br><br>
		In a time when the deal space has been taking a hit, Dealupa’s innovation is a win for both users and the deal sites themselves.
