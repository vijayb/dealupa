		<span class="opening">We love a good deal.</span>
		<br><br>
		The problem is, with thousands of deals out there now, we're finding it harder and harder to keep up. What started as a couple of deal sites soon became hundreds; before long, our inboxes were filling up with dozens of daily emails every morning. Worse, deals we wanted started getting lost in an ocean of deals we didn't want.
		<br><br>
		That's why we put together Dealupa--a single place with all the daily deals...plus a clean and straightforward UI that lets you zero in on exactly the deals you want. Spend more time enjoying deals and less time sifting through them.
		<br><br>
		We started with a few sites covering Seattle. We've since expanded nationwide and expect to add new cities regularly.
		<br><br>
		We'd love to get your feedback. Use the feedback link below.
		<br><br>
		We're two former Googlers in Seattle, both engineers, both with a passion for building products that delight. At Google, we did just that on the Google Maps for mobile, Google News, and Google+ teams.
		<br><br>
		We hope you find Dealupa useful!
